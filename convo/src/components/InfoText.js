        <h2>Convo speaks a language only you understand.</h2>
        <p>Language is an inefficient means of communication.</p>
        <p>We struggle on a daily basis to try to use our words to accurately convey how we feel and what we think. Our ability to articulate and understand dictates the quality of our lives whether it's giving presentations at work, socializing with friends or communicating with loved ones.</p>
        <p>Everyone processes information and language differently. Some people are inspired by the prose of Hemingway and others love the poetry of Rupi Kaur.</p>
        <p>Convo is a tool that takes information whether it's a lecture, discussion, or story and translates it into the “native language” of the reader.</p>
        <p>Through conversations and monitoring the users understanding, Convo discovers how to phrase information specifically for the user.</p>
